# Hampster Dance React Project

This project is a modern recreation of the original Hampster Dance website using a React. 

Why do this? Because I enjoy induing unprovoked insanity into people.

## Features

- Animated dancing hamsters (I found the original GIFs!!)
- Auto-playing background music (Sort of, I had to create an EventListener for user interaction because modern web standards are against fun)
- Responsive design 
- Classic look and feel of the original Hampster Dance website
